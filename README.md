## :pencil: About The Project <a name="Overview"></a>
* a web application to test your cognitive abilities, and see how you compare to others in multiple memory assessments
* each challenge tests a different type of memory, and offers insight into how your results compare to previous averages
* see how personal sentiment affects performance by answering a quick questionnaire before taking each task

Note: this app is just for fun and does not seek to reliable scientific data

<br/>

## :clipboard: Tasks <a name="Tasks"></a>

* Grid Memory - some buttons on a grid will briefly change color, and the user must accurately choose those that changes color

* Recognize Repeating Photos - photos will be shown, and users must press a button when the photo has already been shown

* Letter Mapping - users will be given a key containing three numbers, each mapping to 2 letters. Users much match the letters shown on screen to 
  the number shown in the key. Displaying the key during the game will reduce the points earned, meaning that memorizing the key and quickly matching letters
  to numbers will offer the highest scores
  
* More tasks are planned to be created

<br/>

## :bar_chart: Data & Results <a name="Data"></a>

* Each task will keep track of the average score, as well as the total users who have participated

* Before each challenge, users will be asked to assess their own memory in the related subcategory (visual, verbal, etc...), users will then be able to
  see how the scores differ based on how others grade themselves
